Hi, I am a PhD student at HKU NLP, co-supervised by Prof. [Qi Liu](https://leuchine.github.io/) and Prof. [Lingpeng Kong](https://ikekonglp.github.io/). My research interests lie in empowering LLMs with multi-modal abilities and exploring their emerging capabilities. Previously, I completed my master's degree at Peking University as a member of LANCO, advised by Prof. [Xu Sun](https://xusun.org), and my bachelor's degree at Xidian University.
